## ⚙️ Customization Tips

### Fine-tuning for your room:
- **Too much bass?** Reduce gains at 28Hz/64Hz by 1-2dB
- **Harsh highs?** Slightly reduce 7kHz/14kHz by 0.5-1dB
- **Not enough presence?** Increase 3.5kHz by 0.5-1dB
- **Too wide stereo?** Reduce stereo-base to 0.1 (KEF_LSX) or 0.2 (Cinema)

### Volume considerations:
- Both presets include input gain reduction for headroom
- If too quiet: Increase system volume rather than preset output-gain
- If distortion occurs: Reduce input material volume first

## 🔬 Development Process

These presets were developed through:
1. **Frequency Response Analysis** - Based on Stereophile KEF LSX measurements
2. **Room Acoustic Compensation** - Desktop placement considerations
3. **Iterative Testing** - Extensive listening tests across content types
4. **Precision Tuning** - Q-values and gains optimized for clarity
5. **Overload Protection** - Limiting and gain staging for clean dynamics

## 📊 Frequency Response Targets

**KEF LSX Known Issues Addressed:**
- Weak sub-bass below 50Hz → Enhanced with controlled boost
- Mid-range boxiness around 500-1000Hz → Precisely notched
- Treble rolloff above 10kHz → Extended with careful enhancement
- Near-field reflections → Compensated with EQ adjustments
